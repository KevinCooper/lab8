#Description
This lab requires the combination of lab 6 and 7, both of which are posted in order to have our robot autonomously navigate through a maze. TO achieve full funcitonality, the robot must be able to drive through the 'A' door.  In addition, there is extra credit functionality if the robot is capable of navigating the maze backwards using the same algorithm used to solve the maze.<br>
